# project-euler
 Contains hints and solutions in Python to questions from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)

 Please use the repo to learn and not cheat. I'll put up helpful hints to questions in the directory of the question
 All directories will look like so.
 .
 |
 |--->p***
 |		|--->README.md (This file will contain hints and helpful explanations)
 |		|--->solution.pdf (This file will have a pretty thorough explanation of the problem)
 |		|--->p***.py

So you could use the hints to try and learn, and then head over to the solution if you really just to get the green tick.

# Common tips and hints
 1. When solving any problem, try to generalize the input. This is a common theme that runs throughout CS and Programming in general. For some quick hacks it's okay to rely on the raw power of the machine, but it's better to get to an efficient implementation. So if a problem says solve for 10<sup>3</sup>>, try to think what will happen if I try to solve for 10<sup>4</sup>> or 10<sup>6</sup>>

PS: If you do want to cheat there are other repos out there that give you just the numerical answer. It just defeats the point of the entire website. So I encourage you to try to learn and reach out for help if you are stuck.
