# Project Euler

Hints to questions from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)

Here you can find hints and little breadcrumbs that can lead you to a solution of the problem.

## Why?
Getting stuck on a problem is no fun, and looking up the solution is counterproductive.

These hints should serve as starting points, or should help with common mistakes that you can run into while solving the problems.

## Common tips and hints
1. When solving any problem, try to generalize the input.
	* Some problems could be solved by relying on the raw power of the CPU. The idea is to get to an efficient solution that can run fairly fast as the input size grows.

2. Do not be in a rush to write code. 	
* Stop, evaluate and work it out on a piece of paper before trying to get the computer to solve it.

## Problem 001
Full question: [Mutiples of 3 and 5](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1)

[Arithmetic progressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_progression)

## Problem 002
Full question: [Even Fibonacci numbers](http5s://projecteuler.net/problem=2)

In order to get to the sum, at the very least we need to generate the even numbers of the sequence.

A brute force approach works, but if we could generate only the even numbers in the sequence it would make the solution a lot more efficient.

## Problem 015
Full question: [Lattice paths](https://projecteuler.net/problem=15)

This question essentially is the same as "In how many ways can you arrange _m_ objects and _n_ objects of a kind in a sequence?"

Think combinatorics.
