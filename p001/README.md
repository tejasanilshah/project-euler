# Hints
 Since the input is quite small you could get away with running a loop from 1 to the upper limit.

 This gives you a linear runtime. O(n).


 This problem can be solved in constant time. O(1).

 That approach involves thinking about [Arithemetic Progressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_progression).
